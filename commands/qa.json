    "Leak": "> **Q: When I compile, the window closes mere seconds after opening AND/OR there is red text at the bottom of the window which reads `LoadPortals: couldn't read [MAP_PATH]`, what does this mean?**\n\n**A:** Most likely your map is leaking and as is stated in the channel description of #help-mapping, no, we won't help you with your leak as due to their nature, it's up to the map creator to fix it themselves.\nMore information on what a 'leak' is and how to fix it can be found on the **Valve Developer Community**.\n<https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Leak>",
    "buildcubemaps Crash": "> **Q: When I try running `buildcubemaps` the game crashes, how do I stop this?**\n\n**A:** Instead of running your maps from `common/Portal 2/portal2/maps`, where they are normally compiled to, open Hammer's settings and set the `Place compiled maps in this directory` option in `Build Programs` to `.\\Portal 2\\portal2_dlcX\\maps`, where `X` is the highest present dlc folder (for most players this will be `dlc2`)\nhttps://media.discordapp.net/attachments/721017047550656612/721025341199745054/unknown.png",
    "Packing" : "> **Q: When I upload a map to the Workshop, people complain of 'purple and black checkerboard textures' (<:twp_missing:263076476268707840>)  or 'ERROR models' (<:twp_error:263125752583684114>), but it appears fine on my end, what is happening?**\n\n**A:** Most likely you are not packing custom assets. When you use an asset—whether it be a texture, prop, script or something else—which does __not__ come with Portal 2, you'll have to 'pack' them into your map. The easiest method is to let **TeamSpen's Hammer Addons** to automatically do it for you at compile time. [https://github.com/teamspen210/hammeraddons/releases]\nHowever, setting up this addon can be somewhat convoluted. If you are having trouble, don't hesitate to ask in #help-mapping or the related FAQ post below.\nThere may be times TeamSpen's addons may not be able to pack assets automatically, although these are rare. In such situations, it is recommend you use **VIDE**'s Pakfile Lump Editor. [http://www.riintouge.com/VIDE/]",
    "Packable Assets" : "> **Q: What types of assets can be packed?**\n\n**A:** The following assets __can__ be packed:\n> • Textures\n> • Models\n> • Music\n> • Vscripts\n> • Soundscripts\n> • Particles\nThe following assets __can not__ be packed:\n> • Bink Videos\n> • Custom DLLs\n> • Maps\n> • `scenes.image`",
    "Decompile Maps" : "> **Q: How do I decompile maps? (.bsp files)**\n\n**A:** Decompiling maps is something you should consider doing only for educational purposes, for example, like learning how certain I/O are structured, or how certain parts of a map where bulit etc, on vanilla Portal 2 maps, you are mostly free to do anything you want. However, in case you are planning to decompile and use anything (mostly related to custom assets and or mechanics) in a user created map ( maps from the workshop, or TWP forums), please, contact the creator first to get his/her authorization, and it goes without saying that you should never re-upload maps without permission.\nYou can find the decompiling tools necessary in <#890621364548038666> but, i'll leave the link either way.\nBSPsource: [<https://github.com/ata4/bspsrc/releases/>]",
    "Install Hammer Addons" : "> **Q: How do I install TeamSpen's Hammer Addons?**\n\n**A:** DarviL82 has kindly provided us with an automatic Hammer Addons Installer. You can read its instructions and download its latest version here:\n[<https://github.com/DarviL82/HAInstaller>]\nFor manual installation, refer to the answer in <#721017047550656612>.",
    "Tutorials" : "> **Q: I am entirely new to mapping, someone here sugested that I probably should watch some tutorials first, but, which one I watch?**\n\n**A:** A good one to start is tophattwaffle's v2 hammer series, it has a good base for beginners  and it covers a fair amount of basic skills, he uses CS:S but the techniques are interchangeable.\n[<https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-454Fe3dQH1L38FnKkz_O1CqYx6sKaXk>]",
    "Elevator Videos" : "> **Q.** How do I fix the elevator videos / How do I select an elevator video?\n\nSee this Steam guide: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2483618590\nOr: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/263051726897152001/635658481050976271/elevator.png",
    "Hammer++" : "> **Q.** How do I add Hammer++ to Portal 2?\n\n**A.** Rose wrote up a helpful guide about how to install Hammer++ to Portal 2, which is linked below\n[<https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2742731712>]",
    "VTF Green Tint" : "> **Q. My custom textures are getting green-tinted when I import them through VTFEdit. How do I fix it?**\n\n**A.** The simplest solution is to download VTFEdit Reloaded. It fixes the green tint issue and includes some tweaks and upgrades to the vanilla VTFEdit:\n[<https://www.mediafire.com/file/gsdik14d9kqa7eh/VTFEditInstaller.msi/file>]\nAlternatively, a more \"manual\" solution for the vanilla tool in the next answer:\n\n**A.** Add a solid color layer on top of your texture, with the color `3, 7, 3` (or `#030703`), set to the \"Color Burn\" blending mode. While not a perfect fix, it does offset the green tint enough that it looks mostly imperceptible in the final import.",
    "Skybox" : "> **Q. My skybox texture doesn't work. How do I fix it?**\n\n**A.** Portal 2 doesn't have support for the `Sky` shader. Instead, what you'll need to do is set your texture's shader to `UnlitGeneric`. Make sure to also remove the `$ignorez 1` parameter (if you had it in the first place). All your skybox texture really needs is the following for its VMT files:\n```\n\"UnlitGeneric\"\n{\n    \"$basetexture\" \"skybox/YOUR_TEXTURE_NAME_HERE\"\n}\n```\n\nAs for the VTF files, no special configuration is needed, though setting up the `Clamp S` and `Clamp T` flags (or `Clamp` and `Clamp T` if you use VTFEdit Reloaded) is recommended.",
